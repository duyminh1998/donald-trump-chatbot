what's your proudest achievement?,PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM
what do you want people to know?,"People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate, and epic victory: 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents."

Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page &amp; her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side?"
tell me what you think about the mueller investigation,"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!"

tell me about emanuel macron,"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia.

"Last year on the speed round, you made some North Korea news. It was a format that worked well. Do you remember that? You said you’d be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un? "," That’s right. Look, they haven’t had a missile test, a nuclear test, they haven’t had anything, and when did I leave? Three and a half month  three months ago."
You’re happy with them? ," No, I have greater patience than any human being in the world."
"Yes, yes. ", People don’t understand that about me. I have great patience.
"So, you don’t need to send them signals that time is running out for them to take action? "," So no, I have  I don’t think I have to do anything. I have a  you know, I’ve  I’ve had a good  now, that can always change, but I’ve had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I’m not saying it won’t change. It could change. The whole situation could change. But you’ve had no missile testing, you’ve had no rocket testing, we got back our hostages, and there’s been no nuclear tests. And that’s pretty good. And I signed a document  you know, that document I signed said there will be a denuclearization. You know, everyone says we didn’t agree  we agreed to a lot of very positive things. Did you get a copy of the document?"
"Jumping over to the tariffs on China are you thinking that as soon as the comment period is over on Thursday of next week, that you won’t go? "," Uh, I refuse to say. Not totally wrong. I can’t do that to you, Jennifer. That’s my Jennifer. You know how much I liked her when I first met her, then she started to kill me. But that’s actually not wasn’t your fault. It was somebody that you were dealing with that wasn’t so good. Right? I never blamed you for that. I know the good. But this one you like, right?"
So you will work for  next when next  next  next week’s attempt comes to an end and you will just hit them with the tariffs straight off? ," So here’s the story, just if I could really quickly. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States and its leaders. People don’t like saying that because you have some Republicans that don’t like it and you have some Democrats. I’m not just blaming President Obama. I’m blaming many administrations. China was rebuilt with American dollars. They were taking out $500 billion a year. And, in earlier stages lesser amounts, but massive nevertheless. And I said it’s time to stop. We can’t let this happen. Can’t let it happen. And what I did is, because of North Korea, I delayed my decision by a little bit. I was going to do trade with China right away, and a couple of things happened. One thing happened is I got to know President Xi, who I like a lot. OK? Another thing that happened is with the North Korea  and  and if you people remember, if you go back to the end of the Obama administration, we were ready to go to war with North Korea, just so you understand. You know, when people say, ‘Oh, what have you done?’ We don’t feel that now. OK? I mean, you can say, gee whiz, we’re not going quick or we’re going too quick. You can say whatever you want to say, we were ready to go to war. And when I was in very heated rhetoric, you know, it’s interesting. With him they said, I’m going to cause war, I’m too strong  and then with Putin, they said I’m being too nice. OK? They wanted me to be in a boxing match. I’d like to have a good relationship with Putin. I’d like to have a good relationship with everybody because I think it’s in the best interest of our country. But it is interesting, Jennifer, isn’t it? Remember, they said he’s going to cause a war when I said rocket  you know, when I did the rocket man thing and worse. Much worse.? They said war. And with Putin, which was actually one of my best meetings because of my talk on Syria, Ukraine, Israel and other things. I think it was one of my best meetings. I think the press covered it unbelievably fake. It was real fake news but  but it was a very good meeting. The NATO meeting was phenomenal. You know they’re putting up hundreds of billions of dollars more, and I came out of that one where they said I was too rough on the other presidents and prime ministers of the countries, so OK, give me a break. But in the meantime we were carrying them on NATO. They weren’t paying their bills, or as you would say in your wonderful magazine, they were delinquent. Very delinquent, OK? So we had some very good successes."
"Mr. President, you told the Chinese  the Chinese say, ‘Look, we’re going to wait him out’ because Xi is an autocrat, doesn’t have to do midterm elections. He doesn’t. He can… ", He has his own election. He has a different kind of election.
They think they’re stronger. They think they can outlast you. ," Nobody is waiting us out. Our country is stronger than it’s ever been financially, and nobody is waiting us out. We’re having the best numbers, and by the way, you look at the numbers, you know they adjusted 41 to 42you saw that40you saw that4.1 to 4.2."
"Could you tell us if tomorrow comes and goes, what happens to Canada? What will happen if Canada has... "," I think Canada’s going to make a deal at some point. It may be by Friday, or it may be within a period of time. But ultimately they have no choice."
Do you think that they’ve reached a tentative deal right now? Does Lighthizer have something cooking pretty close? ," I think we’re close to a deal, yes."
"What about on the Mexico deal, was it aimed it China? You look at the Mexico deal, and there’s a lot of thing that  "," China’s  well it was aimed at China in the sense that we will be making a lot of money  we will be taking in a lot more money and jobs that China won’t be getting. So in that respect it was. But not only in China, it was aimed at many countries that, you know, were going in through Mexico and into a backdoor. They were coming in through a backdoor. So in that sense it was aimed at many countries that were taking advantage of the United States. The Mexico deal’s an incredible deal. If you want to keep your companies here  look, I grew up where companies were leaving. NAFTA was the worst deal  one of the worst deals ever made. OK? There were numerous of them. The Iran deal, which, by the way, has had a major impact on Iran. When I came into Iran  when I came into here, it was a question of when would they take over the Middle East. Now it’s a question of will they survive. It’s a big difference in one and a half years."
"Is your goal with China, as a lot of Chinese think, actually to prevent China from becoming the world’s No. 1 economy? "," No, but it’s  it’s  it’s a deal that will  again, the best thing that China and I have going  and  and the U.S. have going  is that President Xi and I have a really great relationship. OK? That being said, he represents China; I represent us. We were going in the wrong direction. The United States  look, since the World Trade Organization, which was probably, I called  I called NAFTA the second-worst trade deal ever made. I would say the WTO was the single worst trade deal ever made. And if they don’t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. We rarely won a lawsuit except for the last year. You know, in the last year, we’re starting to win a lot. You know why? Because they know if we don’t, I’m out of there. I’ll take them out. We’re starting to win lawsuits that we never  you know that. We never won lawsuits because the courts are stacked. You know they  it’s sad. We have a minority on the courts. So, the WTO was a horrible deal. NAFTA was a  they were all bad deals. You know, we made a deal with South Korea; nobody talks about it. We made a deal with South Korea We took the horrible deal that was made by Hillary Clinton where she said 200,000 jobs will be produced  and she was right  for South Korea. They were produced for South Korea, not for us. OK?"
"Would you  would you do a deal with Europe, who have come out this morning saying they would do cars  on autos, they would do zero tariffs with America. So, is that a good deal?... "," It’s not  it’s not good enough, no."
"Not good enough, why? "," No, no. Because they do a lot more auto business than we will ever do. In other words  well, first of all, it’s not just tariffs; they also have barriers up to our cars. They have athey’ll take the barriers down and they’ll charge us no tax, but it’s not good enough, because they will always sell more cars. Their cars  their habits, their consumer habits are to buying their cars  not to buying our cars."
But do you think you can outlast them as well? ," Absolutely, they’re dying to make a deal. Look, it’s all about the cars. And thedo you understand what I mean by that, Jennifer? It’s all about the cars. We can talk steeland I’ve rebuilt the steel industry in this country in six months. It’s rebuilt, it’swhen I say rebuilt, it’s really rebuilding fast. You call up the head of U.S. Steel, chief executive officer, what’s his name? Great guy. He’she’s opening up six or seven plants, he’s going to open up others, he’s spending billions of dollars. You call up Nucor  Nucor, call up the various steel companies. It’s likeit’s like nobody can believe what’s happening with this. So you guys haven’t covered it?"
People are losing their jobs though on the aluminum tariffs and things like that. Is thatdoes that worry you? ," I know, thethe aluminum business is doing much better. It wasit was a dead business. There’s soand I only charged 10 percent on that one because of that. It’s ayou know, it’sit was a little more delicate. Steel isand I’ll tell you what’s going to happen with steel, they were dumping like nobody’s ever seen dumping before. Historic dumping. And don’t believe 2 percent by China. It was trans-shipping. You know, everyone’s saying, well, China was only doing 2 percent. No, China was doing 50 percent. What they were doing is they were trans-shipping steel to other countries that didn’t even have steel plants and steel mills. They were sending them to countries that didn’t even deal in steel, and these countries are dumping here because China didn’t want people to know that they’re sending us 50 percent and more. So you understand what I mean by that, because every time I read an article it says, oh, but China only sends us 2 percent. I say give me a break, take a look at the countries where they’re coming from. Some countries don’t even do steel and they’re sending us 4 percent of the product. Sosobutbut I have to say, the steel industry isis one of my pride and joys. I’m going tonight to Indiana, and I don’t know if you saw the lines, the lines started forming today at 4 o’clock in the morning. They had 45,000 requests forfor 8,000 or 9,000 seats. Is anybody going? Are you going tonight? It’s going to be exciting."
You mentioned currency manipulation with China. Are you now prepared to call them a currency manipulator? You said you’re," Well, we’re doing all the studies. No, we’reit is a formula, and we arewe are looking very strongly at the formula. As you look, as you see what’s gone with the yuan, it’s gone, you know, it’sthey’re trying to make up for lack of business by cutting their currency. ?It’s no good. You can’t do that. That’s not, like, playing on a level playing field. And..."
"But with the  their currency going down is also a function of your one staying quite high. And do you think which is, as you say, partly linked to the Fed. Do you think the president should have the right to be able to approve or disapprove some of the Fed’s decisions? "," Well, look. I put a man in there who I like, who I respect. And in private life, I always liked  in private life, please put it that way.... In private life, I always liked a weak dollar and a low interest rate, OK? A strong dollar was only good if I wanted to buy Turnberry in Europe, in Scotland or if I wanted to buy Aberdeen or if I wanted to buy Doonbeg in Ireland. It was the only thing the strong dollar was good for. That was in my private life. And I did. I bought a lot of things when the dollar was very strong and the, you know, Ireland had crashed and Europe was crashing. I bought a lot of great stuff, including the great Turnberry, as you know, right?"
But you say you don’t think that policy should be... ," No, I  I’m  I’m not look, my businesses have been very strong. I’ve done very well. I understand it. I think I understand it better than the so-called economists, where you  mostly, it’s a flip a coin and pick. Is it heads or tails? They have no clue. But  but at the same time, I’m not sure that we should ever allow politicians to control very important things, you know, strong monetary policy, the things that the Fed right now controls. But China is being accommodated because they can do whatever they want, and the euro is being accommodated because they basically do whatever they want, and we are not being accommodated at all by the trade."
But you don’t regret picking Jay Powell? ," No, I don’t regret. I think somebody else would maybe  what I’m saying is that we are fighting horrible trade deals that were made by people that were either incompetent or didn’t care. And  and I should be  I should be allowed  and  and they  and those  those countries are being accommodated by their monetary policy. Our country is not."
Do you favor the idea of indexing capital gains? , I’m thinking about it. I’m thinking about it.
Are you leaning towards liking it? ," Well, no, I - I  I just  there are a lot of people that love it; there’s some people that don’t. But I’m thinking about it very strongly. I’m also thinking about going, as you know, to a  to a half-time instead of a quarter-time for reporting and guidance."
"Yeah, any closer on that, on making a decision? "," I’ve asked Jay Clayton to look at it very strongly. He’s looking at it. I like the concept, but I’ll  I’ll be relying  the only one that will be fighting us on that will be the accountants."
Do you imagine that you would make a decision before the midterms on indexing? ," I  I don’t want to say that, but it’s something that a lot of people like. How do you feel about that  indexing?"
"On Jeff Sessions, would it be fair to say that Jeff Sessions will be A.G. until at least the mid-terms? "," I wouldI would think so, yeah. I would think so."
Then how many days afterwards? ," Oh, I don’tI don’t even want to get into it. Look. I just want people to do their jobs. I have a great cabinet. I’m really happy with my cabinet. I’ve made some replacements. Mike Pompeo’s becoming a star. You look at my cabinet members, we have really great cabinet members. There are those that say this is the best cabinet ever assembled. We really have greatand you’ve heard that, Sarah, too. We hear it a lot. Weand we have great judges. I put on judges thatwhen I got here, I had 145 openings. Nobody’s ever had that before. And that was because something happened in the last three years of Obama where he didn’t put judges on. I think they forgot. I really do, I believe they forgot. And there’s nothing moreyou know, there’s probably nothing more importantother than war and peace, there’s probably nothing more important."
"But on the other half of that is, maybe Jeff Sessions might not necessarily be safe after the midterms? "," I don’t want to comment on it. Look, I just would love to have him do a great job. And I’d love to have him look at the other side. And I have purposelyand there’s no reason for me to do thisI could go andyou know, I meanI’m allowed to do. You look at Article I, you look at whatever you want to look at, I’m allowed to be very much involved. This is just a witch hunt. Butbut I will tell you that they should be looking at the other side. When you look at Ohrthis is the last, you knowOhr and his wife. And his wife is gettingNellieand his wife is getting paid by Fusion. And Fusion’s getting money from Russia and all this and nobody wants to look at that stuff, and you look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, and you look at what went on there and the things that they were saying and the spying and the surveillance, and a hundred other things. You look at the lies of Comey, the horrible lies. You look at the lies of Brennan. Look at the lies he said. And why aren’t they looking at that side? So I do question, you know, what is Jeff doing? Nowand I just finish with this. I’ll say this. There was no collusion. I think almost everybody, even in your business, is saying there just is no collusion. There were no Russians. If there were, you would have known about it. There was collusion between the Democrats and the DNC and Russia. I do ask, why didn’t the FBI take the server from the DNC? And why didn’t they do it? They didn’t take it. I mean, what kind ofyou mean they wouldn’t give it, they wouldn’t give it to them, they would not give their server. I mean, Jennifer, you’ve figured that one out too a long time ago. And I do say, Arwan from Pakistan, he had three servers, all with congressional medalcongressional people. They just settled the case with him, they gave him nothing. And theyand they never got the servers."
"But if you getif you get subpoenaedif you get subpoenaed by Mueller, would youwould you comply with it? Or would you fight it? "," Well, I’ll see what happens."
"It doesn’t sound as if you’re going to goit doesn’t sound as if you’re going to go voluntarily. So, he wouldis it fair to say, he would have to subpoena? ", I view it as an illegal investigation. It should’ve never been…
So you wouldn’tyou wouldn’t go? ," …it should have beenno, I’m not saying anything. I’m just telling you this, you read any of the greatyou read the great scholars, the great legal  there should have never been a special counsel. It shouldn’t have been set up. Between all of the conflicts, and all of theall of the reasoning that turned out to be wrong, all of the corruption, all of the statements where Comey said in Congress that hehe did things, and he leaked, and he didto get a special counsel and various other things. So, I’d just like to have Jeff Sessions do his job and if he did, I’d be very happy. But the job entails two sides, not one side. Now, I have not purposely, and not from any legal standpoint because from a legal standpoint, I’m allowed to get totally involved. But I have, purposely, not gotten involved. But, you know, at some point I guess that could change."
"Mr. President, there’sthere’s been a lot of talk in Washington, this week, about your CFO from the Trump Organization, Mr. Weisselberg, accepting that immunity deal from prosecutors that delves into your financeyour company’s financial dealings. "," No, he’s 100 percent100 percent."
"The $130,000. Did youdid you know about that before the election? "," Well, I don’t want to get into it because it’s been covered so much. So, we won’t get into that. Let’s get into more important things. I can say this, there’s no campaign violation whatsoever. And if you watch all of the good legal pundits, you’ll see that. No campaign violation whatsoever. There is none. And most of them  other than fake news  admit that. There was no campaign violation."
"There are some in the legal community that say you could prove that if there was a pattern of Michael making payments over a long period of years, then  then it would be argued that it was "," Jennifer, there was no campaign violation  all of them. All I’m saying is this  every lawyer that everybody’s spoken to said there’s no campaign violation. So."
But you’ve spent quite a lot of time attacking them. Is that  do you  do you worry at all about American capitalism ... ," No, no, not at all, because this is  this is the engine for everybody. Without this country it doesn’t work. No, I don’t at all and I think they have to treat people fairly."
"So, it’s just  it’s a pure  it’s a pure thing to do, what they do on their media sides, rather than the business as a whole? ", Yeah.
"You think Google is a good business, you think ... "," Well, if  if you look  if you look, the conservatives have been treated very unfairly. I can tell you from my years, I  I think very few people  I guess, Dan, what do we have now total on the various ..."
Would you  could you  would you want to break up Google or break up Bezos? , I can’t  I won’t  I won’t comment on that. I can’t comment.
It’s something that’s crossed your mind? ," I just can’t comment. No, I don’t want to say that either. I just  I won’t comment on the breaking up of  whether it’s that or Amazon or  or Facebook."
Is Emmet Flood going to be the next White House counsel? , He’s a man I really like and respect. He’s doing a great job.
Is he the frontrunner? , I don’t want to say that. I don’t want to comment on that.
Are there more than one possibility right now? ," I don’t want to comment on it, but I have  I can tell you this, everybody wants the job. Everybody wants it but I  I just don’t want to comment on it."
"If America was attacked by  if there is a terrorism attack, which foreign leader would you call first? ", That’s an interesting  I guess it depends on where the attack took  took place 
Who do you trust and admire? ," I  I think I trust a lot of them. I  I have a great relationship. Sarah, you see it, you go with me. Dan, you see it. I have a great relationship with a lot of foreign leaders, I think a really great relationship with really a lot."
Angela Merkel? ," I think I would have a very good  I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel. An excellent relationship. I just disagree. I don’t think she should be buying oil for Russia  from Russia. I don’t think that, you know, she should be paying 1 percent and we’re paying 4.3 percent for NATO. You know, I have a lot of disagreements with her."
Have you told her that she shouldn’t buy  she shouldn’t buy the oil? , I told her I think it’s ridiculous that you have a NATO to protect yourself from a certain country and then you’re paying a fortune to that certain country. I said what kind of a deal is that?
"But if you had one phone call, there’s a big terrorist attack in New York City and you’ve got to call a foreign leader, who would it be? "," I don’t want to say because I’ll be insulting a lot of other foreign leaders, honestly."
"If he doesn’t  if he doesn’t hand over the pastor, should you  should NATO  should  should Turkey be kicked out of NATO? ", We’re going to see what happens. I  I think...
Is there a chance you might meet Kim in  in New York for the UN General Assembly? ," I don’t know that he’s coming. I really don’t. But I have a good relationship with him, and it’s  it  Isn’t it nice to have a good relationship? And I was going to tell you before, I think I’d have a very good relationship with Putin, but the Russian rigged witch hunt gets  you know, gets in the way of that. It makes it very difficult. It’s a very bad thing for our country."
"If Kim decided to come to the UN in September, it  would you be ready to have that meeting, or does he need to show you a little more? ", I’m  I’m ready  I’m always ready for a meeting.
"Mr. President, as you know, of course John McCain’s remains are on  on  on their way back to Washington now. You had an opportunity to unite the country this week. I’m just wondering if you felt like you screwed it up? "," No, I don’t think I did at all. I  I’ve  I’ve done everything that they requested, and no, I don’t think I have at all. You know, we had our disagreements and they were very strong disagreements. I disagreed with many of the things that I assume he believed in. But with that being said, I respect his service to the country."
Would he  would McCain have been a better president than Obama? , I don’t want to comment on it. I have a very strong opinion on it.
What about Paul Ryan? Would Republicans in the House do better if Paul Ryan were to step down as speaker early? ," I’d  look, here’s  I like Paul Ryan. I actually get along very well with him. I’ve had a much better relationship with Paul Ryan than people understand. And I do like him. And that’s all going to work out. You know, that’s all going to work out."
How many are you going to win by? How many will Republicans win by? ," Well, I don’t want toI don’t want to predict because then if If I’m wrong, you’re going to say, “Oh, he’s devastated”you’re going to say, “He’s devastated that they didn’t win.” So I don’t want to do that, but I think we’re going to do well. Now I’m betting against history because if you look at history, like literally, over 150 years, for whatever reason, when you have the president, that party doesn’t do very well in the midterms. I don’t know why. The advantage we have isI am actually a very popular president, which people don’t like to say, you know. In fact, I guess the Republican poll came out, there’s one at 92 and one at 93 and one at 90, and they’re the highest numbers that have ever been, with the exception of a tiny period of time with a bullhorn. But that period lasted for about a week."
"But do you feel frustrated? Do you the economy, as you say, is growing, end of the longest bull market, all those things. ", Yes.
Do you feel annoyed about the polls? ," Yes, my personal polls are very good. When you look atbut the question is, will they transfer over to people getting out and voting? So if I were runningand you people know this better, that it seems like nobody comes close. I dream about the people that are running. I hope it’s that same group. I hope they don’t change the group. I like the group. They’re great now. You know, take your top 10. Butbut if I were running, people come out and vote. I saw today on Fox, they’re in Indiana, and the level ofof love is just a beautiful thing to watch, and I speak to people, and that’s around the country. They’re happy because the economy is so good. Their 401(k)s are through the roof, et cetera, et cetera. The question is whether or not it’s going to transfer. Now I’m going to work hard, and I’m going to be out campaigning for a lot of people."
"Montana’s going to be interesting, too? "," I’ll tell you one quick story than we’ll finish. So I’m watching television, and I see this young woman on television. I say, “Who’s that?” “Oh, she’s campaigning against Joe.” You know who Joe is, right? So Queens. Crowley. So I say “Ah, let me just watch her for a second”wonderful thing, TiVo. So you go back“huh, tell him he’s going to lose.” Now, I don’t agree with her views, her views are terrible, but that’s Cortez. To just putto use one term. I had a similar thing in Michigan. I was watching an event and I see a man campaigning, a good looking African-American man who is making a beautiful speech, talking about his military service, his leadership, his flying the Apache helicopters. I said “Stop that for a second, go back, I want to see that.” I watched him, I said “He’s a potential star.” And as you know, he was down and I endorsed himspoke to him, I endorsed him and he’s doing really well against an opponent that wasn’t really on the list of potentials, right? And I think John James is going to be very interesting, I think. Watch him."
What about Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon? Who wins out of those two? , Cuomo’s going to win.
But do you think it would hurt your re-election bid or do you think it would help your re-election bid? ," I don’t know, I have no opinion on it. I just don’t think they can do it iflook, I’m doing a great job. You look at the economy, you look at jobs, you look at foreignwhat’s going on with other countries, you look at trade deals. I’m doing a great job. I don’t think thatbecause if they could do that, here’s what would happen: you get elected president and your House is the opposite party, and every time you get elected president, they’re going to impeach the person. That can’t work. In other words, because of the division that you have now thatthat you knowthat you’ve had. Here’s somebodyis this the most divisive you’ve seen it? No, Clinton was worse. I said what about Obama? No, Obama wasn’t as bad as Clinton. And I’m saying to myself, you know, it’s sort of interesting but they say there were years in the Clinton years that were far worse than this. And it’s very interesting. You know we think of this, then of course they can also go back and say how about the Civil War. That was pretty bad too."
Can you get out of Afghanistan? ," But  but I just  I do want to say this  I do want to say this and that will be the last but what that would mean, I’m doing a great job. And fair people would say you look at foreign relations, you look at what’s going on, you look at so many  look at  look at labor. I mean labor loves me. I won the labor vote. You look at those people in line today …"
Don’t forget your wall though. ," Oh no, the wall’s happening. By the way, I’ve already started the wall."
Do you have some creative ideas for paying for it? ," I have a lot of creative ideas for the wall. But just so you understand, I got $1.6 billion in spent. We have another $1.6 billion now. We’re building. We’re building actually 80 miles of the wall right now. The wall is already started. You know the  as you know it’s in San Diego. It’s almost complete all up San Diego in a very bad stretch and we’re building the wall in the bad stretches. You know the stretches. But just so you understand, so you get elected as a Republican or a Democrat and the opposite party gets put into the House. That would mean, oh, let’s impeach him. Can’t do it. If you look at the definition of impeachment that’s a  that’s a high bar and that would take a long time to fight that if you’re doing a good job. And I’m doing a great job. Somebody said what do you grade yourself? I said an A+. Other than that, enjoy yourselves. OK."
"Thank you, sir. ", Take care of yourselves. Thank you very much.
"There are a number of stories out there that you’re angry about the mid-terms, about your treatment in the media, about the way you were treated when you were in Paris. One story even said that you were in a “cocoon of bitterness and resentment.” ", Right.
We’ll get in to all the details later but how dark is your mood? ," It’s very light, it’s fake news, it’s disgusting fake news. I read a front page story in the Washington Post, they never even called me, nobody ever calls me. You know, they hearI don’t even think they have sources I think they just make it up like it’s fiction. And I will tell you I’m extremely upbeat, the White House is running like a well-oiled machine, it’s doing really well, I have great people. I will make some changes but not very many. I’m very happy with my cabinet, other than, you know a couple of exceptions and even there I’m not unhappy. And I will tell you that it’s so wrong, the reporting about me is so wrong. I’m loving what I’m doing, I did well in France, I did have a problem where I wasn’t able to go to a cemetery because the Secret Service would not let me do it. "
Are you comfortable with the way that went down where it kind of looked like your wife was firing one of your advisors?," Well I didn’t know the advisor well, really, and I know they had a lot of problem. My wife did a great job in Africa and she was not treated properly by the press, she really worked so hard. They came to me. They wanted to go a little bit public because that’s the way they felt and I thought it was fine. I met with Mira two days ago and we’re going to move her around. She was with me for a long time, although I don’t know her. She’s really somebody I don’t know very well. But we’re going to move her around because she’s got certain talents. But, frankly, she is not  she’ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way."
Meaning she’s not too diplomatic?," She’s not too diplomatic, but she’s talented."
Are you happy with Kirstjen Nielsen at DHS?," Well, I like her a lot. I respect her a lot. She’s very smart. I want her to get much tougher and we’ll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough. "
What are the chances she’ll be DHS Secretary ," Well there’s a chance. But there’s a chance everybody  I mean that’s what happens in government you leave, you make a name, you go. The people that have left have done very well. The people that have left have done very well  from my White House. I like her very much, I respect her very much, I’d like her to be much tougher on the border  much tougher, period."
So 2020 is no longer written in stone?," It could happen. Yeah, it could  I mean it could be. But let’s see what happens. I have not  look, I have three or four or five positions that I’m thinking about. Of that, maybe it’s going to end up being two. Maybe, but I want to I need flexibility."
"Did you know, before you appointed him, that he had that record and was so critical of Robert Mueller?", I did not know that. I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.
And when you found that out?," I don’t think it had any effect. If you look at those statements those statements that can  they really can be viewed either way, but I don’t think it will have any impact "
"He is going to have to make or could potentially make a lot of big calls in the Mueller investigation. If Mueller decides that he wants to subpoena you, the Attorney General Whitaker can block that. If Mueller issues a final report, he can decide how much goes to Congress or doesn’t go to Congress. You tweeted this week about, quote, “Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs.”", Right.
"If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller investigation, are you OK with that?", Look he  it’s going to be up to him. I think he’s very well aware politically. I think he’s astute politically. He’s a very smart person. A very respected person. He’s going to do what’s right. I really believe he’s going to do what’s right. 
Your team is preparing written answers to questions about ," No, no, no, not my team. I’m preparing written answers. My  I  I’m the one that does the answering. Yes, are they writing them out? "
Are they going to be submitted? ," At some point very soon, yes. I’ve completed them. "
"Is that your final position, that there’s going to be no sit-down interview and nothing written or in person on obstruction? "," I would say probably. Probably. I mean, I can change my mind, but probably. I think we’ve "
No interview? ," I think we’ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we’re finished. "
What are the odds? One in a hundred? What What? ," I don’t do odds, I gave very detailed "
You ran a casino sir. ," You’re right, and very successfully actually. We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn’t have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem, I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn’t, you know, I’ll be told and we’ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end. "
"Have you one, either heard the tape yourself or been briefed on it and if so, to your mind what does it show? "," We have the tape, I don’t want to hear the tape, no reason for me to hear the tape. "
Why don’t you want to hear it sir? ," Because it’s a suffering tape, it’s a terrible tape. I’ve been fully briefed on it, there’s no reason for me to hear it, in fact I said to the people should I? They said: “you really shouldn’t, there’s no reason.” I know exactlyI know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it. "
And what happened? ," It was very violent, very vicious and terrible. "
"Question, did MBS lie to your sir? "," I don’tI don’t know, you know who could really know but I can say this he’s got many people now that say he had no knowledge. "
But what if he’s lying? , As recently as a few days ago. 
Do you just live with it because you need him? ," Well, will anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know? But he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved. You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good. "
"So, if Congress were to move to either try to cut off any U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen or to block any arms sales you won’t go along with it? "," Well I want to see Yemen end but it takes two to tango. Iran has to end it also. And Iran is a different country than it was when I took over, it’s far weakened because of what I did with the Iran  so-called Iran deal, Iran nuclear deal, which was one of the great rip-offs of of all time. But I want Saudi to stop but I want Iran to stop also. "
"When Democrats flipped the House back in 2006 and picked up 30 seats, President Bush 43 had a news conference the next day and said, “We had a thumping.” Last week, in this election, the House picked up, so far it’s 36 seats, it may be on the way to 40 seats and your reaction was that it was almost a complete victory. "," I won the Senate, you don’t mention that. "
"But this was a  this was a historically big defeat in the House. You lost 36, maybe 40 seats. Some would argue that it was a thumping. And I want to talk about some of the ways in which you lost. You lost in traditionally Republican suburbs, not only around liberal cities like Philadelphia and D.C. but also red-state big cities like Houston and Oklahoma City. You lost among suburban women. You lost among independents and, in three key states that I think you remember pretty well  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan  you lost both the governor seats and the senate seats. "," Are you ready? I won the Senate, and that’s historic too, because if you look at presidents in the White House it’s almost never happened where you won a seat. We won  we now have 53 as opposed to 51 and we have 53 great Senators in the U.S. Senate. We won. That’s a tremendous victory. Nobody talks about that. That’s a far greater victory than it is for the other side. Number two, I wasn’t on the ballot. I wasn’t "
"But if you can’t carry  and you certainly didn’t carry it two weeks ago  Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania  you’re not going to get reelected. "," I didn’t run. I wasn’t running. My name wasn’t on the ballot. There are many people that think, “I don’t like Congress,” that like me a lot. I get it all the time; “Sir, we’ll never vote unless you’re on the ballot.” I get it all the time. People are saying, “Sir, I will never vote unless you’re on the ballot. I say, “No, no, go and vote.” “Well, what do you mean?” As much as I try and convince people to go vote, I’m not on the ballot."
"A federal judge who you appointed has just ruled that you must give CNN reporter Jim Acosta his press pass back. Your reaction to the ruling, sir.",
What are your rules going to be? What what is it that you’re saying this is over the line and you lose your press pass  ," Yeah, they’re doing them now. I mean, we’ll have rules of decorum, you know, you can’t keep asking questions, you havewe had a lot of reporters in that room, many, many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he’s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and, you know, just shouting out questions. But but I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody’s acting out of sorts, I will leave, I’ll say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I will leave. And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that’s acting up."
"Why did you call on Acosta in the first place? I mean, it seems to me there’s a simple solution here, just don’t call on him. "," Actually I like to do it, but in many cases I don’t. He’ll stand up, he’s unbelievably rude to Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman, unbelievably rude and I see that and I actually ask her the same. Why do you call on these people that are so nasty? I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows. I mean, with with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen. "
"Let’s get to the bigger issue. In 2017, last year, you tweeted this, and I want to quote it accurately, “The fake news media is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people.” "," That’s true, 100 percent. Not the media."
"But there have been people who have been critical of other presidents, they’re they’re  no president has liked his press coverage. John Kennedy, in your Oval Office, canceled the subscription to the New York Herald-Tribune. Nobody called it the enemy of the American people. "," Chris, I’m calling the fake news is the enemy  it’s fake, it’s phony. "
"But a lot of times, sir, it’s just news you don’t like"," No it’s not, no. No. I don’t mind getting bad news if I’m wrong. If I do something wronglike, for instance, the cemetery. I was not allowed to go because of the Secret Service. Because they expected to take a helicopter –"
"But, sir leaders in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Venezuela, now repress the media using your words. "," I can’t talk for other people, I can only talk for me. I will tell you "
"But you’re  but you’re seen around the world as a beacon for repression, not for  "," The news  Chris  Chris, I’m not talking about you, but you sometimes maybe. But I’m not talking about you. The news about me is largely phony. It’s false. Even sometimes they’ll say, uh, “Sources say.” There is no source, in many casesin many cases there is "
You’re not even going to give them credit for taking down Bin Laden? ," They took him down butlook, look, there’s news right there, he lived in Pakistan, we’re supporting Pakistan, we’re giving them $1.3 billion a year, which we don’t give them anymore, by the way, I ended it because they don’t do anything for us, they don’t do a damn thing for us. "
But but the President [doesn’t] get to decide what’s fair and what’s not. , I can tell what’s fair and not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people.
Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time but he never said we were the enemy of the people. ," Well, no, he didn’t talk about the news, he didn’t talk about anything, I’m only saying it very differently than anyone’s ever said it before, I’m saying fake news, false reporting, dishonest reporting, of which there is a lot, and I know it. See, I know it because I’m a subject of it. A lot of people don’t know it. But when I explain it to them, they understand it. And, Chris, you know that better, you don’t have to sit here and act like a perfect little, wonderful, innocent angel, I know you too well, I knew your father too well, that’s not your gene. But let me tell you "
IlookI think, Fake news 
"I think some of the coverage of you, sirand I’ve said it on the recordis bias, but I don’t think that there is"," Most of it is bias, most of it is bias."
"I don’t know, but the idea that you call us the enemy of the people. ", I’m not calling you that.
"It doesn’t matter whether you call, but when you call CNN and the New York Times andwe, we’re in solidarity, sir. "," I am calling fake news, fake reporting, is what’s tearing this country apart because people know, people like things that are happening and they’re not hearing about it. "
"Where do you rank yourself in the pantheon of great Presidents? There’s Lincoln and Washington, there’s FDR and Reagan, do you make the top 10? ", I think I’m doing a great job. We have the best economy we’ve ever had.
So where do you rank yourself? ," We’re doing really well. We would have been at war with North Korea if, let’s say, that administration continued forward. I would give myself, I wouldlook, I hate to do it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?"
"Can you envision a situation, you talk about six more years. Can you envision a situation well into your second term where you think that you’re so good for the country and so essential for the progress of the country that you would try to amend the Constitution so you could serve a third term? "," No, no."
"But here’s the question, you’re back in Washington on Monday, Veterans Day, why don’t you go across the river to Arlington for that ceremony? Barack Obama went every year he was here in D.C. "," I should have done that. I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know –"
Why haven’t you visited our troops serving in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years you’ve been in office as Commander-in-Chief? ," Well, I think you will see that happen. There are things that are being planned. We don’t want to talk about it because of  obviously because of security reasons and everything else."
"Just before the midterms you said your biggest regret is that perhaps you should have had a softer tone in your two years as president. But since then, some could argue, you’ve been on a tear. ",
Do you want him to rein in Robert Mueller? , “What a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.”]
"Question. I was in Saint Joe’s, Missouri this last week and I was talking to a lot of loyal Republicans. They love what you’ve done to the economy. They love the fact that you have basically put ISIS out of business. The one thing they say is, why do you have to be so divisive? Why don’t you do more to bring the country together? "," I think that if I was very different I wouldn’t have gotten what we had to get. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, we got ANWR approved, we have  we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular thing you can imagine  health care  I got rid of it, everybody said it would be impossible to get rid of it. And many many  you know, the regulations. I think if I was a more modified, more moderate, in that sense, I don’t think I would have done half of the things that I was able to get completed. With that being said, other than you have to have a certain ability to fight back and, as you know, people have  you know, they take strong stands on me both ways, you know, love and hate. I’d like to see it a little bit, maybe, more right down the middle. But tone is something that is important to me. But a lot of times you can’t practice tone because you have people coming at you so hard that if you don’t fight back in a somewhat vigorous way you’re not going to win. And we have to win. This country has to win. We have a lot of victories coming and I think if I  if I go too low-key we’re not going to have those victories."
"So have you gotten comfortable with the place yet, sir? "," I have, I feel very comfortable. It took me a little while. You know, it’s sort of incredible. You say you’re the President of the United States, and I say, wow, and it takes a little while to get over that. "
"How, when you’re sitting at the desk, how do you make decisions? I mean do you agonize over them, do you second guess yourself? How does –"," I don’t think about it, I don’t think about, you know, how I make them. I make what I consider the right decision, I have great people working at the White House, they don’t get enough credit. I have some tremendously talented people and I will talk to them and sometimes I’ll have them go at each other, I do like that, you know let them go at each other. And they do. They’ve very competitive people and at the end I make a decision and it’s certainlyon the economy, a lot of things we’ve beenwe’ve made a lot of good decisions and I want to keep it that way."
Do you ever second guess yourself? Do you ever ," Yes, oh, all the time."
Toughest decision you’ve had to make as President?," Well, I think North Korea’s been very tough because you know we were very close. When I took that over President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that’s by far the biggest problem that this country has. And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I’m very happy with the way we went. I have a very good relationship with –"
Even though there was talk that they putting up new sites? ," Maybe they are, maybe they’re not, I don’t believe that, I don’t. And you know could which isif that’s the way it goes, that’s the way it goes. You know, I go with the way we have to go but so far it’s been good, we have a very good relationship. We’ve made I think some great decisions for the people of this country and I do, you know I put America first and other countries should put themselves first. It’s not like we should putand everybody else should be second to us, no. Other countries are proud of their countries and their leadership put their countries first. But we were putting our country in many cases last. We were more worried about the world than we were worried about the United States, that’s not going to happen with me. "
 Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?," I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again. I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's manmade. I will say this. I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage."
" I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.", And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don't know.
" You know, I I was thinking what if he said, No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change. And I thought, Wow, what an impact.", Well I'm not denying.
" Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?"," You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley."
" the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis? And did the prince give the order to kill him?"," Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out. It's being investigated. It's being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it. And den deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes."
" Jared, your son-in-law. Got on the phone and asked the prince. Did he deny it? Did he "," They deny it. They deny it every way you can imagine. In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer."
" What are you options? Let's say they did. What are your options? Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?"," Well, it depends on what the sanction is. I'll give ya an example. They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it."
 Tell everybody what's at stake here.," Well, there's a lot at stake. There's a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter. There's something you'll be surprised to hear me say that. There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case. So we're gonna have to see. We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment."
" You've had a string of wins lately. Let's see, the economy, the trade deal", Right.
 What about North Korea? Talking about ," Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement. Look, we "
 You say so far?," It's always so far, til everything's done. I I you know, deals are deals, okay? Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter. But I will say this. The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea. I sat with President Obama "
 We were goin' to war?," and we were gonna I think it was going to end up in war. And my impression is and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get. Doesn't get any tougher than that. Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough. We were going to war with North Korea. Now, you don't hear that. You don't hear any talk of it. And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it. And you see that, he's agreed to it. No missiles."
 Do you trust him?," I do trust him, yeah, I trust him. That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong "
 you trust him?," Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you. Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes "
" What? That they're still building missiles, more missiles?"," We don't really know, Lesley. We really don't know. But I assume "
 Suspect that?," Let's say the answer is yes, okay? In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile. They haven't tested a rocket. They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth. And we have a relationship now."
 One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions., We haven't done that.
 Are you prepared to do that? What what does he have to do ," No, No."
" I know, but why do you love that guy?"," Look, look. I I I like I get along with him, okay?"
 But you love him., Okay. That's just a figure of speech.
" No, it's like an embrace."," It well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to get the job done."
 He's a bad guy., Look. Let it be whatever it is. I get along with him really well. I have a good energy with him. I have a good chemistry with him. Look at the horrible threats that were made. No more threats. No more threats.
 Gonna do more?, Might. Might.
 Round three? ," They wanna negotiate, Lesley. They wanna negotiate."
 How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?," Okay. Okay. So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case."
 Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?," No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929."
 You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.," I mean, what's an ally? We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people. But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done."
 It sounds hostile., You know what's hostile? The way they treat us. We're not hostile.
 Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?," Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine. But you know what? We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe. And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade. They're not going to do it anymore. They understand that."
" Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance? It's been going for 70 years. It's kept the peace for 70 years.", You don't know that. You don't know that.
 What's not true?," Frankly, I like General Mattis. I think I know more about it than he does. And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you."
" Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin."," Okay, you ready?"
 I don't understand it., I have been you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference 
 Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations? In poisonings?," Probably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I don't "
 Why not they shouldn't do it. This is a terrible thing., Of course they shouldn't do it-
 do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election? Our election-, They they meddled. But I think China meddled too.
 You are diverting the whole Russia thing., I'm not doing anything.
" What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?"," Well, we'll see what happens come midterms. But "
 Can I assume he's gone?, No. No. You can't assume that.
 Will you. Will you pledge pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?," Well, I I don't pledge anything. But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that. I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind."
" So you've been president for almost two years. Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done? Do you have any regrets?"," So when I won the presidency, I th I I the press treats me terribly. I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest."
 Have you made any mistakes? That's my question., Everybody makes mistakes.
 And what have been yours?," I could have been earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal. The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders. I was getting to know countries. I didn't wanna do it right outta the box. So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier."
 So are you gonna go back to that?," Well, we're looking at a lot of things. Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were they were a laughing stock all over the world."
 Are you willing though I think that you're saying you're it's under consideration.," No, I want all the laws changed."
" Are you willing to reinstitute that policy? You said, We're looking at everything.", I will 
" Okay. Changing subjects again you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military. You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?"," Okay. So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah. Now I say they're babies."
 Who's the toughest?," They're babies, the political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table."
 Give me an example.," Well, I don't wanna give you an example. I'm not lookin' to in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do. Remember that. When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at making deals with other countries. Nobody's been able to do anything like this. Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it. But it's a very deceptive world. The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was. I I and I really mean it. I'm not saying that as a sound bite. I never "
" You won. And then after you won, instead of saying, Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful. Let's heal all of this, you come out and bash the Democrats."," Well, I bashed their attitude. I bashed their statements "
 Do you think you treated her with respect?," I think so, yeah. I did."
 More people gonna go?," Yeah, other people will go, sure."
 Who are you not happy with?," No, I don't wanna say that but"
 What about General Mattis? Is he going to leave?," Well, I don't know. He hasn't told me that. I have "
" The first lady, Melania. She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust."," I feel the same way. I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you."
 It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.," I think so. I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody."
 And you feel comfortable?," I feel very comfortable, yeah."
"What did the crown prince tell you today, exactly, and what is your intelligence telling you?","Well, I just put this out, I guess you saw it. I just have it here. I spoke to the crown prince, so you have that. He said he and his father knew nothing about it. And that was very important. And I spoke to him with Mike Pompeo there. And the crown prince. I spoke to the king yesterday, the crown prince, today wanting to know what was going on, what was happening, and he said very strongly that he and his father knew nothing about it but they are starting a major, they've already started a major investigation to find out. And so the answers will be forthcoming."
Did they raise this idea of rogue killers in any of those conversations?,"Well, the concept of it, I guess. Yesterday, when I spoke with the father, not so much today, but when I spoke to the father, it just sounded to me like he felt like he did not do it. He did not know about it and it sounded like, you know, the concept of rogue killers. But I don't know. I think the investigation will lead to an answer. And they're going to do a very thorough investigation. I believe they're working with Turkey."
But he didn't bring up that? That was something you came up with after the conversation?,"Just the concept of it. No, that was just from my feeling of the conversation with the king, not with the crown prince but with the king."
"Do you believe, sir, do you believe the king and the crown prince? I mean do you find them ... do you find them sort of trustworthy here? And there's been a lot of talk, including from Sen. Graham, who I know is an ally of yours in many ways, that this is the moment that perhaps the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia should be re-evaluated, that things should be done differently going forward. What do you think of that?","Well, I think we have to find out what happened first. You know, here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh. And he was innocent all the way. So I was unconcerned. So we have to find out what happened and they are doing a very major investigation. So is Turkey. Plus, they're putting themselves together and doing it. And hopefully they'll get to an answer as to what happened. But I will say they were very strong in their denial about themselves knowing."
Did they give you any sense of the timetable?,I would say within a week. That's my impression. He said two weeks. But they're going to try and do it in less than a week.
"So moving to the midterms, you're hitting the road for Republicans, obviously.",A little bit.
"So my question is, if Republicans were to lose control of the House on November 6th — or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes to count the votes — do you believe you bear some responsibility for that?","No, I think I'm helping people. Look, I'm 48 and 1 in the primaries, and actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about. But many of those 48, as you know, were people that had no chance, in some cases. We look at Florida, you look at Donovan in Staten Island. He was losing by 10 points, I endorsed him and he won. I could give you a long list of names. Look at Georgia governor of Georgia. And many, many races. And I will say that we have a very big impact. I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of an impact. They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero. Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement."
"Along those lines, in the days before the actual vote was held, former President George W. Bush made a number of calls of senators also sort of lobbying on Kavanaugh's behalf. Does he deserve any of the credit here? Have you spoken to him, have you given him a thank you for that?","I did speak with him, I did. No, I didn't say thank you, per se. But I did speak to him before it and we had a great conversation about Kavanaugh, what an outstanding person he is, which is what he told me. And we had a very pleasant conversation, a very good conversation."
"There are a number of phone calls that you got from folks in that critical period. Did you hear from anyone who serves in the Supreme Court who serves alongside now, the justice?","No, I didn't. Nobody called from the Supreme Court. It's a very august body. It's a group of people that, once you're elevated to that level, you really tend to be in a different place, in a different world. No, I didn't, I never got a call. As an example, I did not get a call from Justice Gorsuch, who would be the most likely, or Justice Thomas. Or Alito. I've got no calls."
Are you prepared for what will happen to your presidency if the Democrats do take back the House?,Sure.
"How will you handle investigations, impeachment prospects?","I think I'll handle it very well. I'm handling already. We have a witch hunt now going on, and I handle it very well, and there was no collusion. Everyone knows it. It's ... People laugh. People are laughing at the concept of it."
What if they go after your tax returns? ,"They have to do whatever they do, and I'll do whatever I do. But I've had the most successful two years. I would say, without question, first two years of office, I've had the most successful two years in the history of this country as a president. And we're not even close, actually, if you think about it. It's not until Jan. 20 so we're not even really close to two years. And, would get me the list? Would you get me the list, please?"
Do you think you have the legal team necessary?,"I have the most successful. Nobody has done what I've done, and nobody has come close in the first two years of office. And that's despite the fighting, the Democrats' obstruction."
"On another topic: Michael Cohen was your personal attorney for many years. He testified under oath in federal court that you directed him to commit a crime. Did you, sir?",Totally false. It's totally false.
So he's lying under oath?,"Oh, absolutely he's lying. And Michael Cohen was a PR person who did small legal work, very small legal work. And what he did was very sad, when you look. By the way, he was in trouble not for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for himself. You do know that? Having to do with loans, mortgages, taxicabs and various other things, if you read the paper. He wasn't in trouble for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for other people. He represented me very little. It's a very low level. And what he was is also a public relations person. And now if he wants to try and get a little bit lighter sentence for what he did ... Totally uninvolved. I wasn't involved and he had other clients, No. 1. And No. 2, he was a contractor to a large extent. But Michael Cohen, if you take a look at what he did, this had to do with loans, and I guess the taxi industry is something that I have nothing to do with, he did this on his own time."
"Sir, as the president of the United States, is it appropriate to call a woman, and even one who is making serious allegations and who you are in litigation against, to call her a horseface?",You know what? You can take it any way you want.
How should we take it?,"Did you see the letter? She put out a letter. I had nothing to do with her. So she can lie and she can do whatever she wants to do. She can hire a phony lawyer. You take a look at this guy, a stone-cold loser. Take a look at his past. They can say anything about me. I'm just saying, I just speak for myself. You take a look, and you make your own determination."
"There's two cases with Stormy Daniels aside from the one yesterday that the judge invalidated, but the hush-deal case continues. Did you ask the lawyer to invalidate the agreement?","Well, you'd have to speak to the lawyers. I don't even know what the lawyers are doing, but they are very good lawyers. They'll figure it out."
"In your interview with '60 Minutes' over the weekend, you were asked about climate change, and you said you believe it, but that also, it could go back. ","I said the worst hurricane was 50 years ago, far worse than what this one was. Then, in 1890, they had one that was even worse. This was No. 3 or 4 or 5. We had worse hurricanes in 1890, we had worse, a worse hurricane 50 years ago. We've gone through a period, actually, fairly recently, where we have very few. I live in Florida to a large extent and spend a lot of time in Florida, and we had a period of time where we went years without having any major problem. And then you have a problem and it goes in cycles, and I want absolutely crystal clear water and I want the cleanest air on the planet and our air now is cleaner than it's ever been. Very important to me. But what I'm not willing to do is sacrifice the economic well-being of our country for something that nobody really knows. And you have scientists on both sides of the issue. And I agree the climate changes, but it goes back and forth, back and forth. So we'll see."
But scientists say this is nearing a point where this can't be reversed.,"No, no. Some say that and some say differently. I mean, you have scientists on both sides of it. My uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years. Dr. John Trump. And I didn't talk to him about this particular subject, but I have a natural instinct for science, and I will say that you have scientists on both sides of the picture."
"Sir, you mentioned, you mentioned more than once that your inclination is not to interfere with the Department of Justice as the special counsel probe continues.","Well, the probe is ridiculous. OK. That that probe was even started. Jeff Sessions should have never recused himself. He did it for ... and he did it immediately. He should have told me that. And he recused himself. And even people that are not my friends say that was a horrible thing that he did to the president, a horrible thing. He should be ashamed of himself for doing it. He should have told me that beforehand. And if he would have told me that beforehand, I probably would have put somebody else in the Department of Justice. But Jeff Sessions should never have recused himself."
"I mean, you can fire him now. Would you want to do that? Will you do that?",I haven't said I was going to fire him or not.
The special counsel has submitted written questions to your lawyers. Have you read those questions? Have you been involved in drafting the response?,"I won't respond, but you're right — we are looking at certain questions having to do with the word collusion. Of course there was no collusion. So we are looking at that, and we'll make a determination."
There are children who have now been reunited with their families who are now showing signs of trauma from their separation experience.,"By the way, many of the children — and this is unfortunate, I covered it so nicely on '60 Minutes,' but they only put on pieces of it, and they were fine but you know they cut, cut, cut because I guess they have so much time, although I heard that they did very nicely on the show. Did they do well?"
"Do you have any regrets or any remorse about how this has impacted children, though?","Here's the thing. I think we've done an incredible job with children. As I just said, we've taken children who have no parents with them standing on the border. We've taken many children, and I'm not talking about a small percentage, I'm talking about a very large percentage where they have no people, no parents. In addition to that, we're separating children who are just met by people that are using them coming into the border, not their parents. They are using them coming into the border. The one thing I will also say is that when a person thinks they will not be separated, our border becomes overrun with people coming in. So that's another problem. With all of that being said, we're getting the laws changed so that catch and release, so that visa lottery, so that chain migration and every other form of incredible stupidity can be taken out of our system."
"But today there are more American troops serving in Afghanistan and in Syria and Iraq, in Africa, in harm's way than when you took office. How do you explain to people at home?","The main thing I have to see is, I have to see safety at home and — not a vast difference, by the way — but a little bit more. But it's not a lot more, it's a little bit more. I have to see safety at home. And if I think people are likely to do some very bad things in faraway places to our homeland, I'm going to have troops there for a period of time. But we've done an excellent job. We've defeated ISIS. ISIS is defeated in all of the areas that we fought ISIS, and that would have never happened under President Obama. In fact, it is going the other way. And I think we fought extremely effectively on everything I've wanted to do. Now there will be a certain point where that takes place."
"John Bolton, though, told us, told my colleague Jon a couple of weeks ago that troops aren't going to come out, aren't going to leave Syria, until Iran is fully out of Syria.","We're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. I want, No. 1, the safety of our country. And if that means knocking the hell out of them, of terrorists, long before they can ever get here, that's OK with me. And if I could help Europe and other places by doing it, that's OK with me. And they're starting to pay us for that, by the way, much more substantially than they ever paid before. You understand that's an important thing because it's unfair that the burden is all on us. As it has been. But we are ... we've made ... we've had tremendous success there. We've had tremendous success in North Korea, tremendous success in North Korea."
"On the subject of American soldiers and military overseas, why have you not yet visited a military base in a combat zone like in Iraq and Afghanistan?","Well, I will do that at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary. I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. I mean, this is the greatest economy we've ever had, best unemployment numbers. Many groups are, you know, we've never even been close to these numbers. I'm doing a lot of things. I'm doing a lot of things. But it's something I'd do. And do gladly. Nobody has been better at the military. Hey, I just got them a pay raise. I haven't had a pay raise in 11 years. I just got them a substantial pay raise. 'They' meaning our military people. I just got them new equipment. They have stuff that was so old that the grandfathers used to fly it. I have done more for the military than any president in many, many years."
Can you give us any update as to the plans for your next meeting with Kim Jong Un?,"Yeah, we will have one, but it is going to be after the midterms because I want to stay around here."
"Will it be here, in the United States, sir?",I want to stay around and help people get elected.
Do you think that meeting would be here? In the U.S.?,"No, I don't think so. I mean, we haven't set it up yet, but I would think not yet. At some point, that will happen, too."
You've spoken about security clearances. Do you have any plans to take any more clearances away any time soon?,"Yeah, I do."
From whom?,People I don't trust.
Any updates on the White House counsel?,"Yes. I've made a decision. He's ... you've been reading a little bit about it. A very fine man, highly respected by a lot of people: Pat (Cipollone)."
And for the U.N. perm rep? For Ambassador Haley's job? Have you made a decision?,"I have many people that want the job. I have such a good relationship with Nikki. And I've talked to her about it, too. I will be talking to her about it. But I have many people that want the job, and I would say I'll be making that decision over the next week or two. They're going to work with Nikki for a little while. She going to go till the end of the year, and they'll be working with Nikki."
"You've been very critical, the last year or so, of the NFL. This year, actually, rating are up a little bit. What do you make of that? What does that say about ...?","Hey, look, I did the NFL a big favor. You know that, right?"
Do you plan to pardon Paul Manafort?,"I never even was asked about it. I haven't thought about it. But, you know, I think it's a very sad, sad situation. And there's another thing that had nothing to do with me. That was from years before. You do understand that, right? Do you understand that? Do you know these Russian hackers you're talking about from Moscow? They have nothing to do with me. How many people are they? Only 28 people? They have nothing to do with me. They were hackers from Moscow. Some of them supported Hillary Clinton. They had nothing to do with me. You look at all the stuff, it's just nothing to do with me."
"Knowing what you know today, is it still appropriate for Secretary Mnuchin to be going to Saudi Arabia next week?","Well, it depends on what we find out over the next couple of days. He doesn't have to make that determination until Friday, and I think we'll also be guided by what other countries are doing. You know, we'll look at that."
What's your responsibility?,"I do think this. I do think that they have ordered billions, one of the largest military orders in the history of the country. I think that we hurt ourselves far more than we hurt Saudi Arabia when we cancel an order like that."
"You've seen American business leaders, though, pull out of that conference. Do you endorse that move?","Too early to say. I have to find out what happened. Once they find out what happened, I'll be able to tell you exactly."
"Would you only serve one term, Mr. President, if you felt like you had done everything you set out to do?","No. Because the other term ... first of all, there's always things to do. Actually, it's a very nice question because I have done so much. People have said that, 'You've done so much. You may have it all put back together. And our country: Make America Great Again.' And they do ask me that question. So if you do all of the things that you're doing and you're given another two years, which is a lot of time because I've done this in far less than two years, and those papers pretty much say it, they do ask that question. There's always something to do. And you know, the new motto is Keep America Great. I don't want somebody to destroy it because I can do a great job. But the wrong person coming in after me sitting right at this desk can destroy it very quickly, if they don't do the right thing. So no I'm definitely running."
Is there someone in particular you'd like to run against?,"So far, all of them. So far, all of them. I don't see any talent. No talent."
No one you're worried about?,I see no talent.
Vice President Biden? Or Sen. Warren? Or anyone?,"Well, Biden ran twice and actually a lot of people think he really ran a third time, but he was so low in the polls that he never registered. But he ran twice. And I call him One Percent Joe because you know he did very poorly and then Obama took him off the trash heap and made him vice president. And in a sense he did a good job as vice president, in my opinion, because Obama liked him, and if President Obama didn't like him, you would have been hearing about it. So in that sense, he, I think, he did actually a nice job because the president of the United States felt very comfortable about him. Like, I like my vice president very, very much. That's an important function."
"Thank you very much, Mr. President.",Thank you all.
Why are you disappointed in the DHS secretary and is John Kelly going to be staying in his job right now?,"So, you know, always in an administration after the midterms you make changes, so, I’m looking at things and I’ve got a lot of options. A lot of people want to come in. A lot of politicians that have had very successful careers that are very good want to come in. So I’m looking at things haven’t made a decision yet. I will be making a decision on Homeland shortly."
"Sure. Could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position? I know you’re happy with Matthew Whitaker, do you have any names? ","Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He’s and he’s, very importantly, he’s respected within DOJ. I heard he got a very good decision, I haven’t seen it. Kellyanne, did I hear that?"
Are you confident that you’re going to win the court case?,"I don’t know, I think that we should. Certainly, you shouldn’t be able to go up into a White House and, on principle, it’s very disrespectful to the rest of the press. You were actually getting up to do a question."
"Sir, right now, in 2010 we saw several pieces of major legislation passed in a lame-duck Congress. What can we expect your and the Republican agenda to be in this Congress? Is it going to be an immigration fix? What about criminal justice reform? What are the two to three things you’re looking at?","We’re working on many things. Criminal justice reform we’re working on very hard. We have a meeting today, do you know about that? We have a meeting today."
"Just one second, sir, on that criminal justice bill. Is that the Jared Kushner-backed bill that you want to focus on?","The answer is I’m looking at it very closely, okay? I am. It’s a good thing. You know, Texas is backing it, if you look at Mississippi and Georgia and a lot of other places, they believe in it, those governors, and they’re conservative people. Rick Perry’s a big fan."
"What about immigration, sir? Are you willing to shut down the government if you don’t get a certain set of policies?","I may be. I may be. I’ll have to see how it plays out. But I may very well be willing to shut down the government. I think it’s horrible what’s happening and, you know, building the wall, it’s in smaller stages, we can build it very quickly. I’m building the wall in smaller stages and we moved the military there, we put up barbed wire, we did all sorts of things. You have to have a barrier. You have to have a barrier."
"While we’re on the subject of Congress, I do want to get does Kevin McCarthy have your full endorsement in the speaker’s race?","Well, I didn’t endorse because I stay out of it, but I like Kevin a lot and I like Jim [Jordan] a lot. I like both of ’em."
How would you like them to work it out?,"Who else is running, nobody, right?"
Would you like to see Jim on the ranking member on Judiciary?,"I would like to see Jim in a high position ’cause he deserves it. He’s fantastic, but I haven’t gotten into the endorsement or not. I just like both of ’em too much, too much to get very much involved. It’s something I shouldn’t be involved in. But Jim is a fantastic guy and Kevin is a fantastic guy and they’re very different and they complement each other."
Is she behaving criminally and should she be removed?,"Look, you know, the bottom line it’s, she’s a disaster. You look at her past, she’s a disaster. Even with me. I won Florida and, you remember? That area, Broward, didn’t come in. It didn’t come in. I think Palm Beach was like they wouldn’t call Florida, I won. Then it got to a point where I won by enough that all the votes of the people that lived there would, you know, in other words you can only put in so many votes, although she may change that system."
"You think they should call Florida right now, sir?","Uh, I think they should’ve called Florida election evening. Well, many votes were added to that, and, you know what’s going on. And now they have mixed them up. You said it better than I did. They mixed the votes up and now you can’t find the ones that were put in, they just put ’em into a batch."
Should she be removed from office?,"Oh, she should have been removed I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up."
How do you prevent this in 2020? From happening when you run for re-election?,"First thing you do is fire her and her cronies. You get ’em out of you get ’em out. And it should have been done, I mean, if there’s anything really that I would be because, again, in the 2016 election, you guys remember, remember how long it took to get Florida?"
So you support the cities giving them tax breaks?,"Well, I think they’re giving up a lot. They’re very expensive deals. Only time will tell. Maybe Amazon will have massive competition and they won’t be the same company in five years, in which case it will be a big mistake. You know, Amazon could have I see Walmart is doing very well and others are building sites. I think that’s going to be a very competitive business someday, Amazon. And I’m not sure that size necessarily helps when you get —"
Do you still think they’re cheating the U.S. postal system?,"Oh, I think they’re getting the bargain of the century. I think that Amazon’s getting and that’s why I’ve asked for a review of that. And others too, you know, not just Amazon. There are classes of companies that are getting the bargain and I think that I may be wrong about this, you’ll check but I think the contract they signed with Amazon was a closed contract. You can’t even see it. It was a sealed contract."
"How do you think the police should handle Antifa, generally?","These people, like the Antifa you’re talking about, the Antifa they better hope that the opposition to Antifa decides not to mobilize. Because if they do, they’re much tougher. Much stronger. Potentially much more violent. And Antifa’s going to be in big trouble. But so far they haven’t done that, and that’s a good thing. But they better hope that the other side doesn’t mobilize, you understand what I’m saying. Because if you look, the other side is the military, it’s the police, it’s a lot of very strong, a lot of very tough people. Tougher than them. And smarter than them. And they’re sitting back and watching and they’re getting angrier and angrier."
What’s your takeaway from the 2018 election and what do you think that means for 2020 for you? ,"I think I did very well. Because if you look at Obama was 60-something odd House seats and lost seven Senate seats. So we picked up three or four Senate seats depending on how it all goes it’s a big pickup. In fact, they say in 80 years I think the presidential party’s only picked up two Senate seats, I picked up three. I mean, assuming that they don’t do any further shenanigans in Florida."
